# About Modbus Client

The client implements access to a remote Modbus device.
However, the client can work not only with one device, 
but with several devices that can be connected to a single network,
which is especially useful when working with RTU and ASCII protocols,
when access to all Modbus servers is realized through a single serial port. 
However, it can also be useful when using the TCP version of the protocol,
for example, if you use the TCP->RTU bridge.

All work is performed within a single project.
The main entities in the project are Port, Device and DataViewItem. 
Port contains network settings for both TCP/IP and serial ports.
Device contains settings for a single device (such as Modbus Unit Address, etc.).
The DataViewItem contains a single data unit to be read from the remote 
device and has many formats to represent the current data.

# Quickstart

![](client_view.png)

To start working with the program, you need to run `client.exe`. Then, by default,
when you first start the program,  \an empty project is created, consisting of a single port,
a device attached to it, and an empty DataView data list.

## Port

To change the port settings, you should double-click on the port name in the project tree 
(or use the menu `Port->Edit Port...`). 
The port must be selected in the project tree.  To add a new port, select `Port->New Port...`

![](client_port_dialog.png)

In this dialog box, you can set the network settings for the port.

## Device

To change the device settings, you need to double click left mouse button on the device name
in the project tree (or use the menu `Device->Edit Device...`).
The device must be selected in the project tree. To add a new device, 
select `Device->New Device...` or `Port->New Device...` to immediately bind this device to the selected port.

![](client_device_dialog.png)

In this dialog box, you can set the device settings, such as the Modbus Unit Address.

## DataView

To add items to the view, you can use the menu `Data->New Item(s)...` or press the `Insert` key.

![](client_dataviewitem_dialog.png)

In this window, you can select all the data parameters to be added to the project, 
such as the device to which the data relates, address, format, and number of such data elements. 
The addresses of the following elements will be automatically calculated as you add them. 
Data parameters can be edited individually directly in the DataView list.

## Runtime

To start the process of polling remote Modbus devices, click `Run` on the shortcut bar
(or the menu `Runtime->Run`). 
After starting the system, project editing is not available (except for some DataViewItem parameters).

After you have finished working with the project, you can save it using `File->Save` or `File->Save As...`.

# Graphical User Interface

![](client_gui_schema.png)

The graphical interface consists of the following main elements:
* `Project View` - a project window that displays the structure of the project,
consisting of such nodes as Port and Device
* `Data View(s)` - lists of data to be read/write
* `LogView` - a window for displaying information
* `Main menu` - access to all the features of the program
* `Tool bar` - access to the most frequently used commands
* `Status bar` - the current status of the program

## Project window

![](client_project_window.png)

It displays the network settings for this project, i.e., the ports (Port) through which the exchange with remote 
Modbus devices takes place, as well as the Modbus endpoints (devices) themselves. 
Many Modbus devices can be specified for one port, so you can not only poll a single device in the Modbus network, 
but also organize an exchange with all devices that are in the same network. 
There can also be several such networks in one project.

Project window can show main settings for Port (port type, host,port) and Device (Modbus Unit Address) 
displayed in `[]`-brackets right of Port/Device name. `[]`-view can be managed using 
`Tools->Settings->View->Use Port/Device name with settings`.

To create new port use menu/context menu `Port->New Port...`.

To edit selected port use menu/context menu `Port->Edit Port...`.

To delete selected port use menu/context menu `Port->Delete Port`.

To create new device for selected port use menu/context menu `Port->New Device...`. 
Also can be used `Device->New Device...` for this purpose and than appropriate port can be selected from list.

`Port->Clear All Devices` delete all devices from selected port.

Such settings as port type, port number, timeouts and others can be seen and modified using `Port Dialog` 
when create or edit port.

To import/export port use menu/context menu `Port->Import Port...` and `Port->Export Port...` respectively.
For such import/export `xml`-format is used.

To create new device use menu/context menu `Device->New Device...`.
Appropriate port can be selected or new port can be created in newly opened Device dialog window.

To edit selected device use menu/context menu `Device->Edit Device...`. 
In newly opened Device dialog window port for current device can be chaged.

To delete selected device use menu/context menu `Device->Delete Device`.

Such settings as device unit addres, maximun amount of data to read/write and others can be seen and 
modified using `Device Dialog` when create or edit device.

To import/export device use menu/context menu `Device->Import Device...` and
`Device->Export Device...` respectively. For such import/export `xml`-format is used.

Also current selected port is displayed in status bar with its statistics.

If you can not see this window, use menu `View->Project`.

## DataView(s) windows

![](client_dataview_window.png)

In these windows, you can specify lists of variables that are read (written) to remote Modbus devices. 
There can be several such lists. These lists contain data for generating Modbus requests
to the corresponding devices, 
data addresses, their polling period and display format.

Evere item has its own status and timestamp. The status mean quality of item. 
The timestamp represents the last date and time when a change of item's value or status was detected.

To create new DataView item(s) use menu/context menu `Data->New Item(s)...`. 
The addresses of the following elements will be automatically calculated as you add them. 

To edit selected DataView item(s) use menu/context menu `Data->Edit Item(s)...`. 

Menu/context menu `Data->Insert Item` or `Insert`-key inserts new item above selected or 
at the end of list if nothing selected. 
The addresses of the following elements will be automatically calculated as you add them.

To delete selected DataView item(s) use menu/context menu `Data->Delete Item` or `Delete`-key. 

There is copy/paste mechanism available in DataView item(s).

There is an import/export mechanism is also available in DataView. 
It can be import/export of selected item(s) in the list 
(`Data->Import Items...`/`Data->Export Items...`, `xml` or `csv` can be choosen) and 
import/export of whole list  (`Data->Import DataView...`/`Data->Export DataView...`,
for such import/export `xml` is used).

DataView item parameters can also be edited individually directly in the DataView list.

DataView columns can be customized using `Tools->Settings->DataView->Columns` globally or
`Data->Edit DataView->Columns` individually.

## LogView window

![](client_logview_window.png)
